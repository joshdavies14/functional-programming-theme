# Functional Programming theme for VS Code

This is a collection of 3 very hastily created themes for VS Code based on the colour scheme of the CS141 Functional Programming module.

## Install instructions

### Option 1 (recommended): Install via Visual Studio Marketplace

Head over to Visual Studio Code Markeptlace (or the Extenstions tab in Visual Studio Code), search for "Functional Programming" and install.

### Option 2: Install from source

While this method works, I recommend using Option 1 for ease of use!

1. Clone this repository into `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions` on Windows or `~/.vscode/extensions` on MacOS or Linux.
2. Reload your VS Code window (`Crtl+Shift+P` to open the Command Pallette, type in `Reload Window` then press Enter.)

### Apply the theme

Click on Settings in the bottom-right corner, then "Colour Theme". You should see "Functional Programming" as an option under "Dark Themes", along with the other 2 options "Functional Programming (Lighter)" and "Functional Programming (Darker)".
