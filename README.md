## Install instructions

### Option 1 (recommended): Install via Visual Studio Marketplace

Head over to Visual Studio Code Markeptlace (or the Extenstions tab in Visual Studio Code), search for "Functional Purple" and install.

### Option 2: Install from source

While this method works, I recommend using Option 1 for ease of use!

1. Clone this repository into `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions` on Windows or `~/.vscode/extensions` on MacOS or Linux.
2. Reload your VS Code window (`Crtl+Shift+P` to open the Command Pallette, type in `Reload Window` then press Enter.)

### Apply the theme

Click on Settings in the bottom-right corner, then "Colour Theme". You should see "Functional Purple" as an option under "Dark Themes", along with the other 2 options "Functional Purple (Lighter)" and "Functional Purple (Darker)".

## Improvements?

Improvements and changes are more than welcome via a pull request. If you do create a PR, please do not change the version number in `package.json` as this is done during the extension build process. Thanks!
